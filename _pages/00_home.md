In August 2024, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) [published](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2024/postquantum-cryptography-fips-approved) the final versions of its new industry standards for quantum-resistant cryptography (a.k.a. post-quantum cryptography). This marks a major milestone which will have a wide-ranging industry impact over the next few years, in the upcoming world-wide transition to deploy security mechanisms resistant to attack by emerging quantum computing technology. 


The aim of the AusQRC workshop is to raise awareness of the upcoming Quantum-Resistant Cybersecurity (QRC) industry transition, the state-of-the-art in QRC research, and overall challenges around QRC deployment, particularly in the Australian context. The workshop program (to be announced) will include a high-profile international speaker as well as speakers from Australian industry and academia. 

### Target Audience
We would like to invite cybersecurity industry and government professionals, Academic researchers, and research students to participate in the event.
