Travel stipends for students to participate in the summer school are available. To be eligible for the stipend, you should:

* be a current student enrolled in universities, and
* the university is not based in Melbourne, Australia

The stipend will cover the return ticket to Melbourne (from the student's base city) and 3 nights' accommodation in Melbourne. **Other costs, such as local transportation (e.g. from airport to hotel) and the visa application fee (for international applicants), will not be covered in the stipend.**

If you are interested in the stipend, please submit your application by **20 Nov 2022 (23:59 AEDT).** 
The notification of the stipend application outcome will be sent by the end of Nov 2022.

**The stipend application has closed. Outcomes will be announced at the end of November.**
